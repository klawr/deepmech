\section{Conclusion}

After examining the possibilities of machine learning and their impact on the different branches of technology, the idea to extend this into the realm of kinematic seems to be a reasonable one.
This project was used to learn the basics needed to apply the methods from scratch, beginning with a simple statistical model which is able to classify handwritten mechanical symbols.
The data suggests that a sufficient algorithm has been found, which not only has a accuracy of over 99\% on the test data, but is remarkably small with only % TODO
parameters and a size of 212kb.

To implement the results into a usable application, especially as API for web applications % TODO mec2 and mecEdit
is the topic of subsequent projects.
Based on the techniques learned in this endeavor other models are subject to be trained to match complete handwritten planar mechanisms.
