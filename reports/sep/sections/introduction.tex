\section{Introduction}

This project builds upon work previously done to learn the fundamentals of machine learning, which can be found at \url{aka.klawr.de/srp}.
The target was to introduce machine learning in to the field of kinematics mainly undertaken in web environment by creating a statistical model to classify handwritten mechanical symbols.

In this project this idea shall be enhanced to detect whole mechanisms by determining the position of the symbols in unspecialized pictures\footnote{The data used to train the symbol classifier assumes symbols which are centered and fill the whole picture}.

After localization is done, the next problem is to detect the connections between nodes.
Several approaches will be tested to detect the best method to accomplish this.
